# Release 3.0

Apollo 3.0 enables L4 product level solution that allows vehicles to drive in a closed venue setting at a low speed. Automakers can now leverage this one stop solution for autonomous driving without having to customize on their own.

* Perception module changes:
  * **CIPV(Closest In-Path Vehicle) detection and Tailgating**: The vehicle in front of the ego-car is detected and its trajectory is estimated for more efficient tailgating and lane keeping when lane detection is unreliable.
  * **Asynchronous sensor fusion**: unlike the previous version, Perception in Apollo 3.0 is capable of consolidating all the information and data points by asynchronously fusing LiDAR, Radar and Camera data. Such conditions allow for more comprehensive data capture and reflect more practical sensor environments.
