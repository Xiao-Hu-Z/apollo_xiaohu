### Product Information

1. **Resolution**: provides near picture quality with over 300 lines of resolution and several hundred pixels in both the vertical and horizontal dimensions.  
2. **Range**: detects both light and dark objects at distances up to 150 meters away which allows cars to react and make decisions at freeway speeds and during complex driving situations.
3. **Sensor fusion**: fuses LiDAR raw data with camera video in the hardware layer which dramatically reduces latency, increases computing efficiency and creates a superior sensor experience.
4. **Accessibility**: enables a compact design which allows for easy and flexible integration without impairing vehicle aerodynamics.  Innovusion’s products leverage components available from mature supply chain partners, enabling fast time-to-market, affordable pricing and mass production.
