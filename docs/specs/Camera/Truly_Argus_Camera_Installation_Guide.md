# Guide for Argus Camera

Argus camera is a joint development venture product of Truly Seminconductors Ltd. and Baidu. The Argus camera features high dynamic range (HDR 120dB), internal/external trigger and OTA firmware update. It is well supported by the Apollo Sensor Unit. This line of product is based on ON Semiconductor MARS.

We recommend using ```three cameras```, one with **6 mm** lens, one with **12 mm** lens and the last one with **2.33 mm** to achieve the required performance for the traffic light detection application.
