#### Installing the Apollo Kernel

The Apollo runtime in the vehicle requires the [Apollo Kernel](https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo-kernel). You are strongly recommended to install the pre-built kernel.

##### Use pre-built Apollo Kernel.

You get access and install the pre-built kernel with the following commands.

1. Download the release packages from the release section on github
```
https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo-kernel/releases
```
2. Install the kernel
  After having the release package downloaded:
```
tar zxvf linux-4.4.32-apollo-1.5.0.tar.gz
cd install
sudo bash install_kernel.sh
```
3. Reboot your system by the `reboot` command

4. Build the ESD CAN driver source code
  Now you need to build the ESD CAN driver source code according to [ESDCAN-README.md](https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo-kernel/blob/master/linux/ESDCAN-README.md)

##### Build your own kernel.
If have modified the kernel, or the pre-built kernel is not the best for your platform, you can build your own kernel with the following steps.

1. Clone the code from repository
```
git clone https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo-kernel.git
cd apollo-kernel
```
2. Add the ESD CAN driver source code according to [ESDCAN-README.md](https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo-kernel/blob/master/linux/ESDCAN-README.md)

3. Build the kernel with the following command.
```
bash build.sh
```
4. Install the kernel the same way as using a pre-built Apollo Kernel.

#### Installing Nvidia GPU Driver

The Apollo runtime in the vehicle requires the [Nvidia GPU Driver](http://www.nvidia.com/download/driverResults.aspx/114708/en-us). You are required to install the Nvidia GPU driver with specific options.

1. Download the installation files
```
wget http://us.download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86_64/375.39/NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-375.39.run
```

2. Start the installation
```
sudo bash ./NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-375.39.run --no-x-check -a -s --no-kernel-module
```

##### Optional: Test the ESD CAN device node
After rebooting the IPC with the new kernel:

a. Create the CAN device node by issuing the following commands in a terminal:

```shell
cd /dev; sudo mknod –-mode=a+rw can0 c 52 0
```
b. Test the CAN device node using the test program that is part of the ESD CAN software package that you have acquired from ESD Electronics.

### Installing the Light Detection and Ranging System (LiDAR)

This section provides descriptions on the installation procedure of HDL-64E S3 LiDAR

#### Mounting

A customized mounting structure is required to successfully mount an HDL64E S3 LiDAR on top of a vehicle. This structure needs to provide rigid support to the LiDAR system while raising the LiDAR to certain height above the ground to avoid the laser beams from the liDAR being blocked by the front and/or rear of the vehicle. The actual height needed for the LiDAR depends on the design of the vehicle and the mounting point of the LiDAR relative to the vehicle. The vertical tilt angle of the lasers normally ranges from +2~-24.8 degrees relative to the horizon. To fully utilize the angle range for detection, on a Lincoln MKZ, we recommend mounting the LiDAR at a minimum height of 1.8 meters (from ground to the base of the LiDAR). 

#### Wiring

Each HDL-64E S3 LiDAR includes a cablebundle to connect the LiDAR to power supply, computer (Ethernet for data transfer, and serial port for LiDAR configuration) and GPS timesync source. 

![LiDAR_Cable](images/HDL64_Cable_whitened_labeled.png)

1. Connection to the LiDAR

   Connect the power and signal cable to the matching ports on the LiDAR

   ![HDL64_Cabling](images/HDL64_Cabling.jpg)

2. Connection to Power Source

   The two AWG 16 wires are used to power HDL-64E S3 Lidar. It requires about 3A at 12V. To make connection to the power source, make full contact with the wires and tighten the screws. 

   ![HDL64_Power_Cable](images/HDL64_PowerCable.jpg)

3. Conection to IPC

   The connection to IPC is through an ethernet cable. Plug the ethernet connector in the cable bundle into an ethernet port on the IPC

4. Connection to GPS:

   HDL64E S3 LiDAR requires the Recommended minimum specific GPS/Transit data (GPRMC) and pulse per second (PPS)signal to synchronize to the GPS time. Customized connection is needed to establish the communication between the GPS receiver and the LiDAR:

   a. SPAN-IGM-A1

   If you configured the SPAN-IGM-A1 as specified in [Configuring the GPS and IMU](#configuring-the-gps-and-imu), the GPRMC signal is sent from the GPS receiver via the User Port cable from the Main port. The PPS signal is sent through the wire cables labeled as “PPS” and “PPS dgnd” from the Aux port. The dash-line boxes in the figure below are available connections that comes with the HDL64E S3 LiDAR and the SPAN-IGM-A1 GPS receiver. The remaining connections need to be made by the user.

   ![Wiring_Schematics_IGM_A1](images/LiDAR_A1_wiring.png)

   b. Propak 6 and IMU-IGM-A1

   If you configured the Propak 6 as specified in [Configuring the GPS and IMU](#configuring-the-gps-and-imu), the GPRMC signal is sent from the GPS receiver via COM2 port. The PPS signal is sent through the IO port. The dash-line boxes in the figure below are available connections that comes with the HDL-64E S3 LiDAR and the Propak 6 GPS receiver. The remaining connections need to be made by the user. 

   ![Wiring_Schematics_PP6](images/LiDAR_PP6_wiring.png)

5. Connection through serial port for LiDAR configuration

   Some of the low-level parameters can be configured through serial port. Within the cable bundle provided by Velodyne Lidar, Inc., there are two pairs of red/black cables as shown in the pinout table below. The thicker pair (AWG 16) is used to power the LiDAR system. The thinner pair is used for serial connection. Connect the black wire (Serial In) to RX, the red wire to Ground of a serial cable. Connect the serial cable with a USB-serial adapter to a computer of choice. 

   ![pinout_table](images/pinout_table.png)

   #### Configuration

   By default HDL-64E S3 has the network IP address setting as 192.168.0.1. However, when we set up for Apollo, we should to change network IP address to 192.168.20.13 . We can use terminal application with termite3.2 and enter the network setting command. The IP address of HDL-64E S3 can be configured following the steps below:

   1. Connect one side of serial cable to your	laptop

   2. Connect the other side of serial cable to HDL-64E S3’s serial wires

   3. COM port default setting

      Baudrate: 9600

      Parity: None

      Data bits: 8

      Stop bits: 1

   4. COM port application

      Download termite3.2 from the link below and install it on your laptop (Windows) 

      [http://www.compuphase.com/software_termite.htm](http://www.compuphase.com/software_termite.htm)

   5. Serial cable connection for COM port between HDL-64E S3 and Laptop

      ![Serial cable connected to laptop.png](images/Serial_cable_connected_to_laptop.png)

   6. Launch **Termite 3.2** from laptop 

   7. Issue a serial command for setting up HDL-64E S3’s IP addresses over serial port "\#HDLIPA192168020013192168020255"

   8. The unit must be power cycled to adopt the new IP addresses

### Installing the IPC

Follow these steps:

1.   Use a voltage converter/regulator to convert the 12 VDC output from the vehicle to desired voltage to power IPC. 

     As recommended by Neousys, use a 12 VDC to 19 VDC converter with maximal output current of 20 A. 

     ![voltage_regulater_converter](images/voltage_converter2.jpg)

     First, connect the two 19 VDC output wires to IPC's power connector (Green as shown below).

     ![ipc_power_RB](images/ipc_power_RB.png)

     Secondly, connect the two cables of 12 VDC input to the power panel in the vehicle. If the size of the wire is too thick, the wire should be splitted to several wires and connect to corresponding ports, respectively.

     ![warning](images/warning_icon.png)This step is necessary. If the input voltage goes below the required limit. It is highly probable to cause system failure.


2.   Place the onboard computer system, the 6108GC, inside the trunk (recommended).

     For example, Apollo 1.5 uses 4x4 self-tapping screws to bolt the 6108GC to the carpeted floor of the trunk. ![IPC-bolt_down-936x720](images/Mount_ipc_on_carpet.jpg)

3. Mount the IPC so that its front and back sides(where all ports are located) face the right side (passenger) or the left side(driver) of the trunk.

This positioning makes it easier to connect all of the cables.

For more information, see:

![online_icon](images/online_icon.png)Neousys Nuvo-6108GC – Manual:

**[Link Unavailable]**

4. Connect all cables, which include:

- Power cable

- Controller Area Network (CAN) cable

- Ethernet cable from the 4G router to the IPC

- GPS Receiver to the IPC

- (Optional) Monitor, keyboard, mouse


a. Connect the power cable to the IPC (as shown):

b. Connect the other end of the power cable to the vehicle battery (as shown):


![IPC-power-cable](images/IPC-power-cable.jpg)

c. Connect the DB9 cable to the IPC to talk to the CAN (as shown):

![DB9_cable](images/DB9_cable.png)

d. Connect:

- the Ethernet cable from the 4G router to the IPC 

- the GPS Receiver to the IPC 

- (optional) the monitor:

![IPC-power-842x636](images/cable_connected_incar.jpg)



#### Taking the Lever Arm Measurement

Follow these steps:

1.    Before taking the measurement, turn on the IPC.


2.    When the IMU and the GPS Antenna are in position, the distance from the IMU to the GPS Antenna must be measured. The distance should be measured as: X offset, Yoffset, and Z offset. The error of offset must be within one centimeter to achieve high accuracy in positioning and localization.

# Setting up the Network

This section provides recommendations for setting up the network.

The IPC that is running the Apollo software must access the Internet to acquire the Real Time Kinematic (RTK) data for accurate localization. A mobile device also needs to connect to the IPC to run the Apollo software.

## Recommendations

Itis recommended that you set up your network according to the following diagram:

![4G_network_setup](images/4G-LTE-setup-6108GC.png)

Follow these steps:

1.   Install and configure a 4G LTE router with Wi-Fi Access Point (AP) capability and Gigabit Ethernet ports.


2.   Connect the IPC to the LTE router using an Ethernet cable.


3.   Configure the LTE router to access the Internet using the LTE cellular network.


4.   Configure the AP capability of the LTE router so that the iPad Pro or another mobile device can connect to the router, and, in turn, connect to the IPC.

![tip_icon](images/tip_icon.png)It is recommended that you configure a fixed IP instead of using DHCP on the IPC to make it easier to connect to it from a mobile terminal.

# Additional Tasks Required

Youwill use the components that you were required to provide to perform the following tasks:

1.   Connect a monitor using the DVI or the HDMI cables and connect the keyboard and mouse to perform debugging tasks at the car onsite.

2.   Establish a Wi-Fi connection on the Apple iPad Pro to access the HMI and control the Apollo ADS that is running on the IPC.

# Next Steps

After you complete the hardware installation in the vehicle, see the [Apollo Quick Start](https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo/blob/master/docs/quickstart/apollo_1_5_quick_start.md) for the steps to complete the software installation.
