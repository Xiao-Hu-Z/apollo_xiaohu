## Introduction

The **Apollo Project** is an initiative that provides an open, complete, and
reliable software platform for Apollo partners in the automotive and autonomous
driving industries. The aim of this project is to enable these entities to
develop their own self-driving systems based on the Apollo software stack.

### Additional Components Required

You need to provide these additional components for the Additional Tasks
Required:

- Apollo Sensor Unit (ASU)
- Apollo Extension Unit (AXU)
- A 4G router for Internet access
- A USB hub for extra USB ports
- A monitor, keyboard, and mouse for debugging at the car onsite
- Cables: a Digital Visual Interface (DVI) cable (optional), a customized cable
  for GPS-LiDAR time synchronization
- Apple iPad Pro: 9.7-inch, Wi-Fi (optional)

The features of the key hardware components are presented in the subsequent
sections.

## Steps for the Installation Tasks

This section describes the steps to install:

- The key hardware and software components
- The hardware in the vehicle

### At the Office

Perform the following tasks:

- Prepare the IPC:

  - Install the CAN card
  - Install or replace the hard drive
  - Prepare the IPC for powering up

- Install the software for the IPC:
  - Ubuntu Linux
  - Apollo Kernel
  - Nvidia GPU Driver

The IPC is now ready to be mounted on the vehicle.

### In the Vehicle

Perform these tasks:

- Make the necessary modifications to the vehicle as specified in the list of
  prerequisites
- Install the major components:
  - GPS Antenna
  - IPC
  - GPS Receiver and IMU
  - LiDAR
  - Cameras
  - Radar

#### Prerequisites

**![warning_icon](images/warning_icon.png)WARNING**: Prior to mounting the major
components (GPS Antenna, IPC, and GPS Receiver) in the vehicle, perform certain
modifications as specified in the list of prerequisites. The instructions for
making the mandatory changes in the list are outside the scope of this document.

The list of prerequisites are as follows:

- The vehicle must be modified for “drive-by-wire” technology by a professional
  service company. Also, a CAN interface hookup must be provided in the trunk
  where the IPC will be mounted.
- A power panel must be installed in the trunk to provide power to the IPC and
  the GPS-IMU. The power panel would also service other devices in the vehicle
  such as a 4G LTE router. The power panel should be hooked up to the power
  system in the vehicle.
- A custom-made rack must be installed to mount the GPS-IMU Antenna, the cameras
  and the LiDAR's on top of the vehicle.
- A custom-made rack must be installed to mount the GPS-IMU in the trunk.
- A custom-made rack must be installed in front of the vehicle to mount the
  front-facing radar.
- A 4G LTE router must be mounted in the trunk to provide Internet access for
  the IPC. The router must have built-in Wi-Fi access point (AP) capability to
  connect to other devices, such as an iPad, to interface with the autonomous
  driving (AD) system. A user would be able to use the mobile device to start AD
  mode or monitor AD status, for example.

#### Diagrams of the Major Component Installations

The following two diagrams indicate the locations of where the three major
components (GPS Antenna, IPC, GPS Receiver and LiDAR) should be installed on the
vehicle:

![major_component_rear_view](images/car_rearview_3_5.png)

## Additional Tasks Required

Use the components that you were required to provide to perform the following
tasks:

1. Connect a monitor using the DVI or the HDMI cables and connect the keyboard
   and mouse to perform debugging tasks at the car onsite.

2. Establish a Wi-Fi connection on the Apple iPad Pro to access the HMI and
   control the Apollo ADS that is running on the IPC.

## Time Sync Script Setup [Optional]

In order to sync the computer time with NTP servers on the internet, you could
use the
[Time Sync script](https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo/blob/master/scripts/time_sync.sh)

## Next Steps

After you complete the hardware installation in the vehicle, see the
[Apollo Quick Start](apollo_3_5_quick_start.md) for the steps to complete the
software installation.
