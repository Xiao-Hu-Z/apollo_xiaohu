# Overview of the Installation Tasks

Installing the hardware and the software components involves these tasks:

**AT THE OFFICE:**
1. Prepare the IPC:
    a. Examine the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) cassette to determine if you need to remove the GPU card (if it was pre-installed).
    b. Prepare and then install the Controller Area Network (CAN) card by first repositioning the CAN card termination jumper before you insert the card into the slot.

2. Install the hard drive (if none was pre-installed) in the IPC.

    You can also choose to replace a pre-installed hard drive if you prefer.

    **Recommendations** :
    - Install a Solid-State Drive (SSD) for better reliability.
    - Use a high-capacity drive if you need to collect driving data.

3. Prepare the IPC for powering up:
    a. Attach the power cable to the power connector (terminal block).
    b. Connect the monitor, Ethernet, keyboard, and mouse to the IPC.
    c. Connect the IPC to a power source.

4. Install the software on the IPC (some Linux experience is required):
    a. Install Ubuntu Linux.
    b. Install the Apollo Linux kernel.

**IN THE VEHICLE:**

- Make sure that all the modifications for the vehicle, which are listed in the section Prerequisites, have been performed.

- Install the major components (according to the illustrations and the instructions included in this document):
    - GPS Antenna
    - IPC
    - GPS Receiver

The actual steps to install all of the hardware and software components are detailed in the section, Steps for the Installation Tasks.

# Steps for the Installation Tasks

This section describes the steps to install:

- The key hardware and software components
- The hardware in the vehicle

## At the Office

Perform these tasks:

- Prepare the IPC:
    - Install the CAN card
    - Install or replace the hard drive
    - Prepare the IPC for powering up

- Install the software for the IPC:
    - Ubuntu Linux
    - Apollo Kernel

### Preparing the IPC

Follow these steps:

1. In the IPC, examine the GPU cassette to determine if there is a pre-installed GPU card, which you need to remove:

    a. Turn over the IPC to unscrew the four screws (shown in the purple squares) on the bottom of computer that are holding the GPU cassette in place:

    ![ipc_gpu_cassette](images/ipc_gpu_cassette.png)

    b. Remove the GPU cassette from the IPC:

    ![ipc_gpu_cassette_remove](images/ipc_gpu_cassette_remove.png)

    c. Remove the GPU cassette from the IPC: Unscrew three additional screws (shown in the purple circles) on the bottom of the GPU cassette to open the cover:

    ![ipc_gpu_cassette_unscrew](images/ipc_gpu_cassette_unscrew.png)

    d. Remove the GPU card (if installed):

    ![ipc_gpu_remove](images/ipc_gpu_remove.png)




2. Prepare and install the CAN card:

    a. Set the CAN card termination jumper by removing the red jumper cap (shown in yellow circles) from its default location and placing it at its termination position:

    ![prepare_can_card](images/prepare_can_card.png)

    **![warning](images/warning_icon.png)WARNING**: The CAN card will not work if the termination jumper is not set correctly.

    b. Insert the CAN card into the slot in the IPC:

    ![insert_can_card](images/insert_can_card.png)

    c. Reinstall the GPU cassette in the IPC:

    ![reinstall_gpu_cassette](images/reinstall_gpu_cassette.png)

3. Install or replace the hard drive.

    You need to install one or two 2.5” SSD or hard drives if none have been pre-installed. As an alternative, you might want to replace a pre-installed hard drive with one of your own (say, an SSD).

    ![tip_icon](images/tip_icon.png) An SSD drive is highly recommended for better reliability. Also consider using a high-capacity drive if you need to collect driving data.

    To install the hard drive:

    a. Unscrew the three screws (shown in the purple circles) to open the hard drive cover (caddy):

    ![hard_drive_unscrew](images/hard_drive_unscrew.png)

    b. Install the drive in the caddy (as shown with an Intel SSD):

    ![tip_icon](images/tip_icon.png) Observe the way the hard drive is situated in the caddy for the installation.
    The Serial Advanced Technology Attachment (SATA) and the power connectors should be placed in the caddy facing the end that has the **two** screw holes showing.

    ![hard_drive](images/hard_drive.png)

       The hard drive in the caddy is now connected:

    ![hard_drive_connect](images/hard_drive_connect.png)

    c. Reinstall the SSD caddy in the IPC:

    ![reinstall_ssd](images/reinstall_ssd.png)

4. Prepare the IPC for powering up:

    a. Attach the power cable to the power connector(terminal block) that comes with the IPC:

    ![warning_icon](images/warning_icon.png)**WARNING**: Make sure that the positive(labeled **R** for red) and the negative(labeled **B** for black) wires of the power cable are inserted into the correct holes on the power terminal block.

    ![ipc_power_RB](images/ipc_power_RB.png)

    b.   Connect the monitor, Ethernet cable, keyboard, and mouse to the IPC:

    ![ipc_power_back](images/ipc_power_back.png)

    ​

    ![tip_icon](images/tip_icon.png)It is recommended that you use a Video Graphics Array (VGA) connector for the monitor for these reasons:

- If you do not see any screen display when the IPC boots up, switch to the VGA input. The Neousys Nuvo-5095GC IPC **always** outputs to a **VGA port** even if there is no monitor connected. Consequently, the Linux installer might “elect” to output to a VGA port instead of a DVI port.
- If you do not see a dialog window during the installation process when using a dual-monitor setup, try switching between VGA and DVI to find it. The Linux installer might detect two monitors and use them both.

For better display quality, you have the option to:

- Connect to another monitor using a DVI cable, or a High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HMI) with DVI-HMI adapter
- Use the DVI/HDMI port on the same monitor

    c. Connect the power:

    ![ipc_connect_power](images/ipc_connect_power.png)




### Installing the Software for the IPC

This section describes the steps to install:

- Ubuntu Linux
- Apollo Kernel

![tip_icon](images/tip_icon.png)It is assumed that you have experience working with Linux to successfully perform the software installation.

#### Installing Ubuntu Linux
Follow these steps:

1. Create a bootable Ubuntu Linux USB flash drive:

    Download Ubuntu (or a variant such as Xubuntu) and follow the online instructions to create a bootable USB flash drive.

![tip_icon](images/tip_icon.png)It is recommended that you use **Ubuntu 14.04.3**.

![tip_icon](images/tip_icon.png)You can type F2 during the system boot process to enter the BIOS settings. It is recommended that you disable Quick Boot and Quiet Boot in the BIOS to make it easier to catch any issues in the boot process.

For more information about Ubuntu, see:
![online_icon](images/online_icon.png) Ubuntu for Desktop web site:

[https://www.ubuntu.com/desktop](https://www.ubuntu.com/desktop)

2. Install Ubuntu Linux:

    a.   Insert the Ubuntu installation drive into a USB port and turn on the system.
    b.   Install Linux by following the on-screen instructions.

3. Perform a software update and the installation:
    a.   Reboot into Linux after the installation is done.
    b.   Launch the Software Updater to update to the latest software packages (for the installed distribution) or type the following commands in a terminal program such as GNOME Terminal.
    ```shell
    sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade
    ```

    c. Launch a terminal program such as GNOME Terminal and type the following command to install the Linux 4.4 kernel:

```shell
sudo apt-get install linux-generic-lts-xenial
```
![tip_icon](images/tip_icon.png)The IPC must have Internet access to update and install software. Make sure that the Ethernet cable is connected to a network with Internet access. You might need to configure the network for the IPC if the network that it is connected to is not using the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP).


#### Installing the Apollo Kernel

The Apollo runtime in the vehicle requires the [Apollo Kernel](https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo-kernel). You are strongly recommended to install the pre-built kernel.

##### Use pre-built Apollo Kernel.

You get access and install the pre-built kernel with the following commands.

1. Download the release packages from the release section on github
```
https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo-kernel/releases
```
2. Install the kernel
After having the release package downloaded:
```
tar zxvf linux-4.4.32-apollo-1.0.0.tar.gz
cd install
sudo bash install_kernel.sh
```
3. Reboot your system by the `reboot` command
4. Build the ESD CAN driver source code
Now you need to build the ESD CAN driver source code according to [ESDCAN-README.md](https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo-kernel/blob/master/linux/ESDCAN-README.md)

##### Build your own kernel.
If have modified the kernel, or the pre-built kernel is not the best for your platform, you can build your own kernel with the following steps.

1. Clone the code from repository
```
git clone https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo-kernel.git
cd apollo-kernel
```
2. Add the ESD CAN driver source code according to [ESDCAN-README.md](https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo-kernel/blob/master/linux/ESDCAN-README.md)

3. Build the kernel with the following command.
```
bash build.sh
```
4. Install the kernel the same way as using a pre-built Apollo Kernel.

##### Optional: Test the ESD CAN device node
After rebooting the IPC with the new kernel:

a. Create the CAN device node by issuing the following commands in a terminal:

```shell
cd /dev; sudo mknod –-mode=a+rw can0 c 52 0
```
b. Test the CAN device node using the test program that is part of the ESD CAN software package that you have acquired from ESD Electronics.


The IPC is now ready to be mounted on the vehicle.

## In the Vehicle

Perform these tasks:

- Make the necessary modifications to the vehicle as specified in the list of prerequisites
- Install the major components:
    - GPS Antenna
    - IPC
    - GPS Receiver


### Prerequisites

**![warning_icon](images/warning_icon.png)WARNING**: Prior to mounting the major components (GPS Antenna, IPC, and GPS Receiver) in the vehicle, certain modifications must be performed as specified in the list of prerequisites. The instructions for making the mandatory changes in the list are outside the scope of this document.

The list of prerequisites are as follows:

- The vehicle must be modified for “drive-by-wire” technology by a professional service company. Also, a CAN interface hookup must be provided in the trunk where the IPC will be mounted.

#### Taking the Lever Arm Measurement

Follow these steps:

1.    Before taking the measurement, turn on the IPC.


2.    When the IMU and the GPS Antenna are in position, the distance from the IMU to the GPS Antenna must be measured. The distance should be measured as: X offset, Yoffset, and Z offset.

The error of offset must be within one centimeter to achieve high accuracy in positioning and localization.

# Setting up the Network

This section provides recommendations for setting up the network.

The IPC that is running the Apollo software must access the Internet to acquire the Real Time Kinematic (RTK) data for accurate localization. A mobile device also needs to connect to the IPC to run the Apollo software.

## Recommendations

Itis recommended that you set up your network according to the following diagram:

![4G_network_setup](images/4G_network_setup.png)

Follow these steps:

1.   Install and configure a 4G LTE router with Wi-Fi Access Point (AP) capability and Gigabit Ethernet ports.


2.   Connect the IPC to the LTE router using an Ethernet cable.


3.   Configure the LTE router to access the Internet using the LTE cellular network.


4.   Configure the AP capability of the LTE router so that the iPad Pro or another mobile device can connect to the router, and, in turn, connect to the IPC.

![tip_icon](images/tip_icon.png)It is recommended that you configure a fixed IP instead of using DHCP on the IPC to make it easier to connect to it from a mobile terminal.

# Additional Tasks Required

Youwill use the components that you were required to provide to perform the following tasks:

1.   Connect a monitor using the DVI or the HDMI cables and connect the keyboard and mouse to perform debugging tasks at the car onsite.

2.   Establish a Wi-Fi connection on the Apple iPad Pro to access the HMI and control the Apollo ADS that is running on the IPC.

# Next Steps

After you complete the hardware installation in the vehicle, see the [Apollo Quick Start](https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo/blob/master/docs/quickstart/apollo_1_0_quick_start.md) for the steps to complete the software installation.
