    This attempts to remove the specified prefix from the specified path. The

    matched against complete path components (e.g. ``a/*/`` is okay, but
    ``a*/`` is not treated as a glob and will be matched literally). Due to
    Starlark limitations, at most one ``**`` may be matched.

    Args:
        path (:obj:`str`) The path to modify.
        prefix (:obj:`str`) The prefix to remove.

        :obj:`str`: The path with the prefix removed if successful, or None if
        the prefix does not match the path.

def output_path(ctx, input_file, strip_prefix, package_root = None):

    This computes the adjusted output path for an input file. Specifically, it
    a) determines the path relative to the invoking context (which is usually,
    but not always, the same as the path as specified by the user when the file
    was mentioned in a rule), without Bazel's various possible extras, and b)
    optionally removes prefixes from this path. When removing prefixes, the
    first matching prefix is removed.

    This is used primarily to compute the output install path, without the
    leading install prefix, for install actions.

    For example::

        install_files(
            dest = "docs",
            files = ["foo/bar.txt"],
            strip_prefix = ["foo/"],
            ...)

    The :obj:`File`'s path components will have various Bazel bits added. Our
    first step is to recover the input path, ``foo/bar.txt``. Then we remove
    the prefix ``foo``, giving a path of ``bar.txt``, which will become
    ``docs/bar.txt`` when the install destination is added.

    The input file must belong to the current package; otherwise, ``None`` is
    returned.

    Args:
        input_file (:obj:`File`): Artifact to be installed.
        strip_prefix (:obj:`list` of :obj:`str`): List of prefixes to strip
            from the input path before prepending the destination.

        :obj:`str`: The install destination path for the file.
